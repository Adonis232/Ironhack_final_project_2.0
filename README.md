## Premier League and NFL QB stats analysis



Premier League visualization and analisys








This is my final project for [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es) ,I'm going to analize the EPL and make a document with all data from historical data, just as a starting point to use at the end ofeach season to decide on haow to plan the squads and to see how some events affect team performances (new manager, signings, major injuries...)






### Technologies used:

    -Pandas
    -Numpy
    -Beautiful Soup
    -Matplotlib
    -Seaborn
    -Collections
    -Datetime
    -Itertools
    -Ipython
    -Glob
    -Requests




## Data sources:

On this project we used various data resources, mainly I used data scrapped from https://fbref.com, thanks to Octavio to provide it when I needed it.

For the odds and bet scores I used the data provided by https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

Total expenses and and team balance are scrapped from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/premier-league/einnahmenausgaben/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/0?ids=a&sa=&saison_id=2000&saison_id_bis=2019&nat=&pos=&altersklasse=&w_s=&leihe=&intern=0)

## NFL QB comparasion

Data scrapped from [Pro-football-reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm)

The tutorial to make the radar I found it here (https://python-graph-gallery.com/390-basic-radar-chart/) and of course YouTube


## Next steps...

Next stops woulb be to create a pipeline so we could get the daa and the analysis done automatically just by indicating position, and salary cap 
for our NFL players.

For the Premier League I would have to create the dashboard to compare the data from each season, team, players... And I would have to create a scrapper to get salaries to compare perfomance/salary.
