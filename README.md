## Premier_league_analysis



Premier League visualization and analisys








This is my final project for [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es) ,I'm going to analize the EPL and make a document with all data from historical data, just as a starting point to use at the end ofeach season to decide on haow to plan the squads and to see how some events affect team performances (new manager, signings, major injuries...)
This document is meant to be sent to a GM, there are a lot of data to add to it.
Due to issues with Tableau I had to change it and use [Flourish] ()to do the visualizations you can see them on my [account]()

On this project we used various data resources, mainly I used data scrapped from https://fbref.com, thanks to Octavio to provide it when I needed it.

For the odds and bet scores I used the data provided by https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

Total expenses and and team balance are scrapped from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/premier-league/einnahmenausgaben/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/0?ids=a&sa=&saison_id=2000&saison_id_bis=2019&nat=&pos=&altersklasse=&w_s=&leihe=&intern=0)


All visualizations will be posted on my [Flourish]() profile
