Premier League visualization and analisys








On this project Im going to analize the EPL and try to see the insights obut what it is needed for a fresh-out-of-promotion team to stay in the Premier League and code a model to predict if a team will stay in the league or, otherwise, it will be relegated to the premiership.







## Technologies used:

-Pandas
-Numpy
-Beautiful Soup
-Tableau
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn



On this project we used various data resources, mainly I used data scrapped from https://fbref.com, thanks to Octavio to provide it when I needed it.

For the odds and bet scores I used the data provided by https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php


All visualizations will be posted on my Tableau Public profile
